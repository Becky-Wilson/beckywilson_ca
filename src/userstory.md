# Sarah's Fictional User Story

Sarah enjoys a variety of activities but never knows how much time she spends on anything. She forgets which app she uses to keep track of which habits. She finds it challenging to go to her social media accounts to give or see encouragement. After logging in, she gets sidetracked on different topics or just forgets what she was going to do. Feeling discouraged, she wonders if there is a better way.

A friend, Mary, invites her to her Habit Party for walking. She checks out Habit Party and creates an account. She adds some of her other habits in addition to the walking habit with Mary. Now she tracks how many glasses of water she drinks each day, how many words she writes, and how many hours she sleeps each night. She loves being able to add notes for that day so she remembers why she didn't reach her goal. Things like attending a course or going out with friends. The frustration she's felt at herself is lessened now that she remembers why she made the choice she did. The best part is that it doesn't take long.

Mary invites other friends to their walking habit. The group has grown, and some people are looking for more of a challenge. Mary announces that she is going to start a new habit for Couch To 5K. She sends an invitation to everyone in the group. Sarah decides to skip it, so she doesn't see the habit in her list. When she goes to the group, she can see the C25K habit in addition to the walking habit, but until she joins a habit, she's not able to comment on that habit. She can participate in the general group chat.

Sarah decides to participate in NaNoWriMo's events this year and invites her writing group to track their writing together. Sarah creates the group and shares the name so her writing friends can join. More writing friends join the group. Sarah creates an event for NaNoWriMo, and members can accept the invitation or decline. When they accept, they get to edit the name of their habit from the default created by Sarah. They can track their words, pages edited, and add a line of text each day. Commenting is connected to the event.

Sarah is pleased with the progress she's made. She's better able to focus on her goals and sees her friends succeeding in their goals too. She's become healthier by drinking water and walking regularly. Her sleep has improved too. She was able to easily see the correlation between the days she walked and a good sleep. With her mind less fuzzy, she's considering adding new goals to her life. She laughs to herself as she realizes she'll have to create another habit. Now that her novel is ready to publish, she'll need to remember to check in on her social media to connect with fans. Or maybe she will start a book club group with her fans. She could reach her reading goals and enjoy spending time her fans at the same time.

Another win-win!
