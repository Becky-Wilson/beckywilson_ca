        <h1>Creator Website Templates</h1>
<p>These website templates are designed for non-tech minded creators. Originally intended for early creators, I quickly learned during discovery that experienced creators and other business owners might be interested in using these templates as well. The minimum viable product is for early creators who often only need a one- or two-page site. Additional iterations will allow for larger sites with additional features with increased costs.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Templates are designed to allow creators to select a header style, footer style, and main pages, along with additional blocks. Creators submit their text along with their font selection, colors, and any images to me. Once I prepare a draft site, they critique it and provide any corrections. Once those are implemented, they have a live site using the creator's domain. The creator is encouraged to purchase their own domain so they have complete control and I reduce my risk. Straightforward, step-by-step instructions are provided to the creator the domain and the website are connected.</p>
<h3>Page Structure</h3>
<p>After considering basing the design structure on genre and art styles, I settled instead on experience level and image use. The number and placement of images impacts the page design more significantly than genre or style.</p>
<p>The site structure range is set at three levels. Simpler sites will be more comfortable for new creators, and the more expansive site templates will satisfy the more experienced creators. Simpler sites are also ideal for creators who want their own page but primarily use social media for updates and sharing their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brochure style (all on one page)</li>
<li>Creations (artwork, books, pottery, etc.)</li>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Newsletter signup block</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Patreon/support</li>
<li>Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Page options are designed for specific content, but creators can mix and match as they see fit. Email marketing services can be included in place of the newsletter signup block. Sample sites will be shown using a brochure style, a multi-page site, and a complex site.</p>
<h3>Design System Options</h3>
<p>Three design systems will be available initially. These are used as a base, with shades of the provided colors used for depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text color plus one spot color.</li>
<li>Text color plus two colors (two dark or two bright)</li>
<li>Text color plus two contrasting colors (one dark and one bright)</li>
</ul>
<p>These options, along with images, should allow creators to present the feel of their artwork to potential readers, clients, or agents. Typically, creators will have images of their work. However, sourcing images is an additional cost.</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Due to the ease at which images can mess up websites, images need to be added by me unless arranged otherwise. This will save everyone frustration. Text can be changed by the creator through an interface. Instructions are provided.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>The intent is to keep this cost effective as well as simple and easy. The initial cost structure concept is below. This is subject to change as more research and tests are completed. However, the brochure or one-page cost is not expected to change.</p>
<p>Each level includes one form or connection to an email marketing platform. Also included is one change to any page during a quarter. The change can be requested at any point, they roll-over to the next quarter if not used, and additional changes can be added for additional cost.</p>

<h3>Patrons</h3>
<p>During discovery, some potential users suggested offering the ability for users to sponsor a base site for a creator. In effect, they would become a patron of an unnamed creator, supporting them by providing a basic website. I loved the idea. This option will be available on my billing page, which is yet to be created. Logistics still need fine-tuned to allow both parties to be anonymous yet provide confirmation that funds are used for the intended purpose.</p>
<p>If you are a creator who could use a patron, please contact me. Your site will not appear differently than any others; an unnamed patron will just cover the costs of your website.</p>
<br>
<h3><em>Summary, repeated from <a href="../sitedesign">Website Design</a></em></h3>
<p>Many creators find websites annoying. They need their website. They use their website. And they want someone else to take care of their website. The effort spent on supposedly easy-to-use options are not cost-effective. The learning curve is steep and exhausts the creator's limited time and energy.</p>
<p>Early creators need to be particularly strategic about their focus. Sure, everyone needs to manage their time well. But early creators are lucky to have an hour each day to spend creating, and they need to spend that time creating, not learning about how to select a theme, change options, and check security. Experienced creators know that, eventually, some business-related tasks need to be outsourced. Paying someone else to manage responsibilities they don't enjoy frees up their time for the parts of their business they love.</p>
<p>These templates are designed to allow creators to have their own, simple site without spending time learning technical details. It allows them to have their site and create their art too.</p>
